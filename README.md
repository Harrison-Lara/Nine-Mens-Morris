### Overview

Your customer is asking you to develop software simulatingthe board game Mill, also known as Nine Men's Morris (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Men's_Morris). The software should allow a human player to play against either a human or a computer opponent1. You may determine the functional and quality requirements according to the rules of the game(e.g., placing pieces, moving pieces, and flying), future enhancement for the variants of Nine Men's Morris(e.g., Six Men’s Morris and Twelve Men’s Morris), and your imagination. You may implement the softwareas a standalone program, a webapplication, or a mobile appusing a general-purpose object-oriented programming language of your choice. Your development environment must include a unit test framework (e.g., xUnit)for writing and executing test code.You are expected to maximize the practices of object-oriented techniques, especially if your chosen programming language originated from a non-OO paradigm. You should use a public project hosting site such as github.com, and a version control system such asgit or subversion, unless you have made prior arrangements with the instructor.

### Deliverables

The development process consists of three iterations (sprints). In each sprint, the minimum conditions of “Definitions of Done” for the implementation of required user stories include all acceptance criteria passing(through automated tests or completed performance of manual tests) and all unit-level tests passing, in addition to the required documentation. At the end of each sprint, your team will demonstrate your working software to the teaching assistant or the instructor, and submit a project report including the main software artifacts, such as product backlog and sprint backlog. The demonstration should show that your working software has met the minimum conditions of “Definitions of Done” of the corresponding sprint and present any unique features or enhancements of your project. The detailed instructions and templates of the project reports will be provided in separate documents. 

The reports will be incremental, expanded and improved upon from one sprint to the next.
 
• Sprint 1: Create a project plan, specify allrequirementsofthe target software (i.e., all user stories and their acceptance criteriafor a human player to play against either a human or a computer opponent), and implement the primitive functions (e.g., board visualization and pieceplacementfor both players). Note that the board class should be separated from its graphical user interface. 

• Sprint 2: Implement all the functions for a human player to play a complete game against a human opponent. Such functions include placing pieces, checking mill formation, moving pieces, flying pieces, and determining whether the game is over or not.•Sprint 3: Enhance the software to allowa human player to play against a computer opponent.The computer opponent should make a reasonable attempt at beating the human player. Optimal or perfect play is not required, though.
